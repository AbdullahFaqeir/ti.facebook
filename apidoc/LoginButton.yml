summary: A Facebook login button.
description: |
    The Login Button created by <Modules.Facebook.createLoginButton>.  This is a 
    Facebook button that does not require a click event handler or any listeners.  
    Click events on the button are automatically handled by the Facebook module.

    The button changes its label to reflect the current state of the Facebook 
    session.  For example, if the user is already logged in, this button will show "Logout".

    See the examples in the <Modules.Facebook> documentation.

    In Android, the button's width will change depending on the current state it is in. When
    logged out, it will show "Log in with Facebook" and its width will match the length of
    the text. When logged in, it will show "Log out" and its width will match the length of
    the text.

    In iOS, the width is fixed and hence should be specified. Eg.'loginButton.width = 200'
    See the examples in the <Modules.Facebook> documentation.

        An array of permissions to request

        Set the permissions to use when the session is opened. The permissions here can 
        only be read permissions. If any publish permissions are included, the login 
        attempt by the user will fail. The LoginButton can only be associated with either 
        read permissions or publish permissions, but not both. Using both readPermissions 
        and publishPermissions on the same instance of LoginButton will result in an 
        exception being thrown.

        This method is only meaningful if called before the session is open. If this is called
        after the session is opened, and the list of permissions passed in is not a subset
        of the permissions granted during the authorization, it will log an error.

        Since the session can be automatically opened when the LoginButton is constructed, it's 
        important to always pass in a consistent set of permissions to this method, or manage 
        the setting of permissions outside of the LoginButton class altogether (by managing 
        the session explicitly).
